# Project Name: Death File

Group: Julio, Diana, Nur

Description: The site features an autocomplete search for anime, whether they're shows or movies.

Features: 
1) Ability to search for anime
2) Clear button clears search and restarts search input process
3) Search button animation made with only HTML and CSS 
 

Difficulties: 
1) Aligning the divs (title, search bar, search results, and search button). It was also a challenge to make the page responsive when there is only a small amount of width to work with.
 
2) It was a little difficult to begin working on the server in the beginning of the project.

3) By far, the most difficult part was getting the bottom border radius of the search bar to work while the search results were displayed, while not displayed, and when the search input was cleared. We had to utilize both CSS and Javascript to fix thr problem.
